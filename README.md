# Hey There! I am **Dor** 👋
## About Me

Hello there, fellow enthusiast in the realms of technology and cybersecurity! 

I'm Dor, a Computer Science graduate proficient in Java, Swift, Python, and C/C++. I enjoy exploring the possibilities offered by different programming languages, from the elegance of Swift to the raw power of C/C++.


Outside of coding, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity, particularly in areas like encryption, ethical hacking, and networking and I am continuously learning and expanding my knowledge in these fields.


In my journey through the ever-evolving world of technology, I like to work on various projects and contribute to coding innovation, every line of code I write feels like adding a stroke to the canvas of progress.


Please note that while I am passionate about technology, I prioritize responsible practices. I never share fully ready exploits or weaponized tools and always ensure that my work does not cause harm.


I am currently open to job opportunities and would be happy to connect with me on Twitter.


Also Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter to discuss any collaborations or opportunities further.
